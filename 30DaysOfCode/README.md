# Hacker Rank 30 Days of code

30 Days of Code is an opportunity for you to learn how to code or brush up on your fundamentals. Each day, you'll unlock a new challenge and a corresponding video tutorial to help you learn.

The tutorial is Java-based, but you can also choose other popular languages to submit your solution. Topics include if-else statements, recursion, data structures and more.

I decided to improve my programming skills in python.
